  ebiff is a mail notification agent, like biff or Xbiff, for the GNU/Linux
  operating systems (and other posix operating systems).

* What the e of ebiff stands for? *

  ebiff is an extensible mail notification agent, it is also an enhanced biff
  clone.

* What is ebiff able to do? *

  ebiff is plugin based, so its capabilityes are only related to the plugins
  already written. There are two types of plugins: mailbox and notifier.
  
  These are the mailbox plugins:
    maildir
      Allows ebiff to access mailboxes in maildir format
    mbox
      Allows ebiff to access mailboxes in mbox format
      
  These are the notifier plugins:
    gtk2
      This plugin shows the mailbox status in one or more windows, like gbuffy,
      but is really more customizable.
    xosd
      This notifier prints an on-screen notice.
    sox
      You can associate a sound with a mailbox status change.
    flite
      Flite can synthesize a voice that says what you want when a mail arrives,
      like "you got new mail"
    stdout
      This is a simple and debugging purpose only plugin.
    utmp
      Broadcast-print mailbox status on users termanals.

* What is ebiff development status? *

  ebiff is beta, not really tested, but works fine for me. Please submit bug
  reports and suggestions to the author.
  
* Where can I find some documentation about ebiff's configuration file? *
  
  The manual is included in the binary distributions an is
  generated automatically if you compile it from the sources.
