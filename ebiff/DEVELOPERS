* Compilation * 
 
 ebiff uses simple makefile to build. The only strange thing is that it
 runs contrib/checkplugins.sh to decide which plugins it should build.
 So you may hack on a this simple script to make ebiff compile your new
 plugin. The script is really simple, no explanation needed.

* A new plugin *
 
 The best way is to copy the simplest plugin on the same type and change it.
 stdout or sox are good examples. Use the sox multithreaded approach if the 
 notification action may stop ebiff for a long time. Notifier::Notify() 
 should be a "fast" function.

* Steps for the new plugin *

 - Copy the old plugin, change all names (plugin name should be a simple one,
   no - or / or spaces).
 - hack checkplugins.sh
 - edit grammar.lua (really simple)
 - edit parser.cc (The switch statement at the end of the file.
 - make
 - edit debian/control, debian/ebiff-??-yourplugin.install
 - test it a bit.
 - send me the patch from the most recent upstream version.
